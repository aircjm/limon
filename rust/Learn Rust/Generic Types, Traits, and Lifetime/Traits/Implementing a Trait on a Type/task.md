Now that we’ve defined the desired behavior using the `Summary` trait, we can
implement it on the types in our media aggregator. The listing below shows an
implementation of the `Summary` trait on the `NewsArticle` struct that uses the
headline, the author, and the location to create the return value of
`summarize`. For the `Tweet` struct, we define `summarize` as the username
followed by the entire text of the tweet, assuming that tweet content is
already limited to 280 characters.


```rust,noplayground
pub struct NewsArticle {
    pub headline: String,
    pub location: String,
    pub author: String,
    pub content: String,
}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
    }
}

pub struct Tweet {
    pub username: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub reply: bool,
    pub retweet: bool,
}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
    }
}
```

#### Implementing the `Summary` trait on the `NewsArticle` and `Tweet` types.

Implementing a trait on a type is similar to implementing regular methods. The
difference is that after `impl`, we put the trait name that we want to
implement, then use the `for` keyword, and then specify the name of the type we
want to implement the trait for. Within the `impl` block, we put the method
signatures that the trait definition has defined. Instead of adding a semicolon
after each signature, we use curly brackets and fill in the method body with
the specific behavior that we want the methods of the trait to have for the
particular type.

After implementing the trait, we can call the methods on instances of
`NewsArticle` and `Tweet` in the same way we call regular methods, like this:

```rust,ignore
let tweet = Tweet {
    username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
    content: String::from(
        "of course, as you probably already know, people",
    ),
    reply: false,
    retweet: false,
};

println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
```

This code prints `1 new tweet: horse_ebooks: of course, as you probably already
know, people`.

Note that because we defined the `Summary` trait and the `NewsArticle` and
`Tweet` types in the same *lib.rs* in the listing "Implementing the `Summary` trait on the `NewsArticle` and `Tweet` types", they’re all in the same
scope. Let’s say this *lib.rs* is for a crate we’ve called `aggregator` and
someone else wants to use our crate’s functionality to implement the `Summary`
trait on a struct defined within their library’s scope. They would need to
bring the trait into their scope first. They would do so by specifying `use
aggregator::Summary;`, which then would enable them to implement `Summary` for
their type. The `Summary` trait would also need to be a public trait for
another crate to implement it, which it is because we put the `pub` keyword
before `trait` in Listing 10-12.

One restriction to note with trait implementations is that we can implement a
trait on a type only if either the trait or the type is local to our crate.
For example, we can implement standard library traits like `Display` on a
custom type like `Tweet` as part of our `aggregator` crate functionality,
because the type `Tweet` is local to our `aggregator` crate. We can also
implement `Summary` on `Vec<T>` in our `aggregator` crate, because the
trait `Summary` is local to our `aggregator` crate.

But we can’t implement external traits on external types. For example, we can’t
implement the `Display` trait on `Vec<T>` within our `aggregator` crate,
because `Display` and `Vec<T>` are defined in the standard library and aren’t
local to our `aggregator` crate. This restriction is part of a property of
programs called *coherence*, and more specifically the *orphan rule*, so named
because the parent type is not present. This rule ensures that other people’s
code can’t break your code and vice versa. Without the rule, two crates could
implement the same trait for the same type, and Rust wouldn’t know which
implementation to use.
