Now that you know how to define and implement traits, we can explore how to use
traits to define functions that accept many different types.

For example, in the second listing of this section, we implemented the `Summary` trait on the
`NewsArticle` and `Tweet` types. We can define a `notify` function that calls
the `summarize` method on its `item` parameter, which is of some type that
implements the `Summary` trait. To do this, we can use the `impl Trait`
syntax, like this:

```rust,ignore
pub fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```

Instead of a concrete type for the `item` parameter, we specify the `impl`
keyword and the trait name. This parameter accepts any type that implements the
specified trait. In the body of `notify`, we can call any methods on `item`
that come from the `Summary` trait, such as `summarize`. We can call `notify`
and pass in any instance of `NewsArticle` or `Tweet`. Code that calls the
function with any other type, such as a `String` or an `i32`, won’t compile
because those types don’t implement `Summary`.

#### Trait Bound Syntax

The `impl Trait` syntax works for straightforward cases but is actually
syntax sugar for a longer form, which is called a *trait bound*; it looks like
this:

```rust,ignore
pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```

This longer form is equivalent to the example in the previous section but is
more verbose. We place trait bounds with the declaration of the generic type
parameter after a colon and inside angle brackets.

The `impl Trait` syntax is convenient and makes for more concise code in simple
cases. The trait bound syntax can express more complexity in other cases. For
example, we can have two parameters that implement `Summary`. Using the `impl
Trait` syntax looks like this:

```rust,ignore
pub fn notify(item1: &impl Summary, item2: &impl Summary) {
```

If we wanted this function to allow `item1` and `item2` to have different
types, using `impl Trait` would be appropriate (as long as both types implement
`Summary`). If we wanted to force both parameters to have the same type, that’s
only possible to express using a trait bound, like this:

```rust,ignore
pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item1: &T, item2: &T) {
```

The generic type `T` specified as the type of the `item1` and `item2`
parameters constrains the function such that the concrete type of the value
passed as an argument for `item1` and `item2` must be the same.

#### Specifying Multiple Trait Bounds with the `+` Syntax

We can also specify more than one trait bound. Say we wanted `notify` to use
display formatting on `item` as well as the `summarize` method: we specify in
the `notify` definition that `item` must implement both `Display` and
`Summary`. We can do so using the `+` syntax:

```rust,ignore
pub fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {
```

The `+` syntax is also valid with trait bounds on generic types:

```rust,ignore
pub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {
```

With the two trait bounds specified, the body of `notify` can call `summarize`
and use `{}` to format `item`.

#### Clearer Trait Bounds with `where` Clauses

Using too many trait bounds has its downsides. Each generic has its own trait
bounds, so functions with multiple generic type parameters can contain lots of
trait bound information between the function’s name and its parameter list,
making the function signature hard to read. For this reason, Rust has alternate
syntax for specifying trait bounds inside a `where` clause after the function
signature. So instead of writing this:

```rust,ignore
fn some_function<T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 {
```

we can use a `where` clause, like this:

```rust,ignore
fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32
    where T: Display + Clone,
          U: Clone + Debug
{
```

This function’s signature is less cluttered: the function name, parameter list,
and return type are close together, similar to a function without lots of trait
bounds.
