One special lifetime we need to discuss is `'static`, which means that this
reference *can* live for the entire duration of the program. All string
literals have the `'static` lifetime, which we can annotate as follows:

```rust
let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime.";
```

The text of this string is stored directly in the programâ€™s binary, which
is always available. Therefore, the lifetime of all string literals is
`'static`.

You might see suggestions to use the `'static` lifetime in error messages. But
before specifying `'static` as the lifetime for a reference, think about
whether the reference you have actually lives the entire lifetime of your
program or not. You might consider whether you want it to live that long, even
if it could. Most of the time, the problem results from attempting to create a
dangling reference or a mismatch of the available lifetimes. In such cases, the
solution is fixing those problems, not specifying the `'static` lifetime.
