Letâ€™s briefly look at the syntax of specifying generic type parameters, trait
bounds, and lifetimes all in one function!

```rust
use std::fmt::Display;

fn longest_with_an_announcement<'a, T>(
    x: &'a str,
    y: &'a str,
    ann: T,
) -> &'a str
where
    T: Display,
{
    println!("Announcement! {}", ann);
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

This is the `longest` function from earlier that returns the longer of
two string slices. But now it has an extra parameter named `ann` of the generic
type `T`, which can be filled in by any type that implements the `Display`
trait as specified by the `where` clause. This extra parameter will be printed
before the function compares the lengths of the string slices, which is why the
`Display` trait bound is necessary. Because lifetimes are a type of generic,
the declarations of the lifetime parameter `'a` and the generic type parameter
`T` go in the same list inside the angle brackets after the function name.
