Consider a short program that finds the largest number in a list, as shown in
the code snippet below.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let mut largest = number_list[0];

    for number in number_list {
        if number > largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!("The largest number is {}", largest);
}
```

#### Code to find the largest number in a list of numbers.

This code stores a list of integers in the variable `number_list` and places
the first number in the list in a variable named `largest`. Then it iterates
through all the numbers in the list, and if the current number is greater than
the number stored in `largest`, it replaces the number in that variable.
However, if the current number is less than or equal to the largest number seen
so far, the variable doesnâ€™t change, and the code moves on to the next number
in the list. After considering all the numbers in the list, `largest` should
hold the largest number, which in this case is 100.
