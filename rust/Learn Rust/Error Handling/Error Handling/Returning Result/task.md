This function refuses to generate text to be printed on a nametag if you pass it an empty string.
It'd be nicer if it explained what the problem was, instead of just sometimes returning `None`.

<div class="hint">
Why not use the <code>Result</code> type instead of <code>Option</code>?
</div>

<div class="hint">
To make this change, you'll need to:

- update the return type in the function signature to be a `Result<String, String>` that
  could be the variants `Ok(String)` and `Err(String)`
- change the body of the function to return `Ok(stuff)` where it currently
  returns `Some(stuff)`
- change the body of the function to return `Err(error message)` where it
  currently returns `None`
</div>
