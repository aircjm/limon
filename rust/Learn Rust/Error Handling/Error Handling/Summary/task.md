Rust’s error handling features are designed to help you write more robust code.
The `panic!` macro signals that your program is in a state it can’t handle and
lets you tell the process to stop instead of trying to proceed with invalid or
incorrect values. The `Result` enum uses Rust’s type system to indicate that
operations might fail in a way that your code could recover from. You can use
`Result` to tell code that calls your code that it needs to handle potential
success or failure as well. Using `panic!` and `Result` in the appropriate
situations will make your code more reliable in the face of inevitable problems.

See the section with ideas and guidelines on what to use in your own code, `panic` or `Result`, in 
[The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch09-03-to-panic-or-not-to-panic.html).
