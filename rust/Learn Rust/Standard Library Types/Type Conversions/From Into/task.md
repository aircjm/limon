The From trait is used for value-to-value conversions.
If From is implemented correctly for a type, the Into trait should work conversely.
You can read more about it at https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html

We implement the Default trait to use it as a fallback
when the provided string is not convertible into a Person object. Your task is to complete this implementation
in order for the line `let p = Person::from("Mark,20")` to compile.
Please note that you'll need to parse the age component into a `usize`
with something like `"4".parse::<usize>()`. The outcome of this needs to
be handled appropriately.


Steps:
1. If the length of the provided string is 0, then return the default of Person
2. Split the given string on the commas present in it
3. Extract the first element from the split operation and use it as the name
4. If the name is empty, then return the default of Person
5. Extract the other element from the split operation and parse it into a `usize` as the age. If while parsing the age, something goes wrong, then return the default of Person. Otherwise, return an instantiated Person object with the results
