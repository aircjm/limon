Type casting in Rust is done via the usage of the `as` operator.
Please note that the `as` operator is not only used when type casting.
It also helps with renaming imports.

The goal is to make sure that the division does not fail to compile
and returns the proper type.

<code>average</code> function into the expected return type.</div>
