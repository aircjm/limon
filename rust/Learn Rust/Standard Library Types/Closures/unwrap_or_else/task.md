Let’s look at the definition of the `unwrap_or_else` method on `Option<T>` that we used [earlier](course://Standard Library Types/Closures/Capturing the Environment with Closures):

```rust
impl<T> Option<T> {
    pub fn unwrap_or_else<F>(self, f: F) -> T
    where
        F: FnOnce() -> T
    {
        match self {
            Some(x) => x,
            None => f(),
        }
    }
}
```

Recall that `T` is the generic type representing the type of the value in the `Some` variant of an `Option`. That type `T` is also the return type of the `unwrap_or_else` function: code that calls `unwrap_or_else` on an `Option<String>`, for example, will get a `String`.

Next, notice that the `unwrap_or_else` function has an additional generic type parameter, `F`. The `F` type is the type of the parameter named `f`, which is the closure we provide when calling `unwrap_or_else`.

The trait bound specified on the generic type `F` is `FnOnce() -> T`, which means `F` must be able to be called at least once, take no arguments, and return a `T`. Using `FnOnce` in the trait bound expresses the constraint that `unwrap_or_else` is only going to call `f` at most one time. In the body of `unwrap_or_else`, we can see that if the `Option` is `Some`, `f` won’t be called. If the `Option` is `None`, `f` will be called once. Because all closures implement `FnOnce`, `unwrap_or_else` accepts the most different kinds of closures and is as flexible as it can be.

> Note: Functions can implement all three of the `Fn` traits too. If what we want to do doesn’t require capturing a value from the environment, we can use the name of a function rather than a closure where we need something that implements one of the `Fn` traits. For example, on an `Option<Vec<T>>` value, we could call `unwrap_or_else(Vec::new)` to get a new, empty vector if the value is `None`.
