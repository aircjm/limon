Now let’s look at the standard library method `sort_by_key` defined on slices, to see how that differs. It takes a closure that implements `FnMut`. The closure gets one argument, a reference to the current item in the slice being considered, and returns a value of type `K` that can be ordered. This function is useful when you want to sort a slice by a particular attribute of each item. In the following Listing, we have a list of `Rectangle` instances and we use `sort_by_key` to order them by their `width` attribute from low to high:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut list = [
        Rectangle {
            width: 10,
            height: 1,
        },
        Rectangle {
            width: 3,
            height: 5,
        },
        Rectangle {
            width: 7,
            height: 12,
        },
    ];

    list.sort_by_key(|r| r.width);
    println!("{:#?}", list);
}
```

##### Example of using `sort_by_key` and a closure to sort a list of `Rectangle` instances by their `width` value

This code prints:

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.41s
     Running `target/debug/rectangles`
[
    Rectangle {
        width: 3,
        height: 5,
    },
    Rectangle {
        width: 7,
        height: 12,
    },
    Rectangle {
        width: 10,
        height: 1,
    },
]
```

The reason `sort_by_key` is defined to take an `FnMut` closure is that it calls the closure multiple times: once for each item in the slice. The closure `|r| r.width` doesn’t capture, mutate, or move out anything from its environment, so it meets the trait bound requirements.

In contrast, the next Listing shows an example of a closure that only implements `FnOnce` because it moves a value out of the environment. The compiler won’t let us use this closure with `sort_by_key`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut list = [
        Rectangle {
            width: 10,
            height: 1,
        },
        Rectangle {
            width: 3,
            height: 5,
        },
        Rectangle {
            width: 7,
            height: 12,
        },
    ];

    let mut sort_operations = vec![];
    let value = String::from("by key called");

    list.sort_by_key(|r| {
        sort_operations.push(value);
        r.width
    });
    println!("{:#?}", list);
}
```

##### Example of attempting to use an `FnOnce` closure with `sort_by_key`

This is a contrived, convoluted way (that doesn’t work) to try and count the number of times `sort_by_key` gets called when sorting `list`. This code attempts to do this counting by pushing `value`, a `String` from the closure’s environment, into the `sort_operations` vector. The closure captures `value` then moves `value` out of the closure by transferring ownership of `value` to the `sort_operations` vector. This closure can be called once; trying to call it a second time wouldn’t work because `value` would no longer be in the environment to be pushed into `sort_operations` again! Therefore, this closure only implements `FnOnce`. When we try to compile this code, we get this error that `value` can’t be moved out of the closure because the closure must implement `FnMut`:

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
error[E0507]: cannot move out of `value`, a captured variable in an `FnMut` closure
  --> src/main.rs:27:30
   |
24 |       let value = String::from("by key called");
   |           ----- captured outer variable
25 | 
26 |       list.sort_by_key(|r| {
   |  ______________________-
27 | |         sort_operations.push(value);
   | |                              ^^^^^ move occurs because `value` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
28 | |         r.width
29 | |     });
   | |_____- captured by this `FnMut` closure

error: could not compile `rectangles` due to previous error
```

The error points to the line in the closure body that moves `value` out of the environment. To fix this, we need to change the closure body so that it doesn’t move values out of the environment. If we’re interested in the number of times `sort_by_key` is called, keeping a counter in the environment and incrementing its value in the closure body is a more straightforward way to calculate that. The closure in the following Listing works with `sort_by_key` because it is only capturing a mutable reference to the `num_sort_operations` counter and can therefore be called more than once:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let mut list = [
        Rectangle {
            width: 10,
            height: 1,
        },
        Rectangle {
            width: 3,
            height: 5,
        },
        Rectangle {
            width: 7,
            height: 12,
        },
    ];

    let mut num_sort_operations = 0;
    list.sort_by_key(|r| {
        num_sort_operations += 1;
        r.width
    });
    println!("{:#?}, sorted in {num_sort_operations} operations", list);
}
```

##### Example of using an `FnMut` closure with `sort_by_key` is allowed

The `Fn` traits are important when defining or using functions or types that make use of closures. The next section discusses iterators, and many iterator methods take closure arguments. Keep these details of closures in mind as we explore iterators!
