Complete this function to return the factorial of num.

Do not use:
- `return`

For extra fun, don't use:
- imperative style loops (`for`, `while`)
- additional variables

For the most fun, don't use:
- recursion

<div class="hint">
In an imperative language, you might write a for loop that updates
a mutable variable. Or, you might write code utilizing recursion
and a match clause. In Rust you can take another functional
approach and compute the factorial elegantly with ranges and iterators.
