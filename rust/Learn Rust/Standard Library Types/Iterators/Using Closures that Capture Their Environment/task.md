Now that we’ve introduced iterators, we can demonstrate a common use of closures that capture their environment by using the `filter` iterator adaptor. The `filter` method on an iterator takes a closure that takes each item from the iterator and returns a Boolean. If the closure returns `true`, the value will be included in the iterator produced by `filter`. If the closure returns `false`, the value won’t be included in the resulting iterator.

In the code snippet below, we use `filter` with a closure that captures the `shoe_size` variable from its environment to iterate over a collection of `Shoe` struct instances. It will return only shoes that are the specified size.

```rust
    #[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
    struct Shoe {
        size: u32,
        style: String,
    }

    fn shoes_in_my_size(shoes: Vec<Shoe>, shoe_size: u32) -> Vec<Shoe> {
        shoes.into_iter()
            .filter(|s| s.size == shoe_size)
            .collect()
    }

    #[cfg(test)]
    mod tests {
        use super::*;

        #[test]
        fn filters_by_size() {
            let shoes = vec![
                Shoe { size: 10, style: String::from("sneaker") },
                Shoe { size: 13, style: String::from("sandal") },
                Shoe { size: 10, style: String::from("boot") },
            ];

            let in_my_size = shoes_in_my_size(shoes, 10);

            assert_eq!(
                in_my_size,
                vec![
                    Shoe { size: 10, style: String::from("sneaker") },
                    Shoe { size: 10, style: String::from("boot") },
                ]
            );
        }
    }
```

##### Using the filter method with a closure that captures shoe_size

The `shoes_in_my_size` function takes ownership of a vector of shoes and a shoe size as parameters. It returns a vector containing only shoes of the specified size.

In the body of `shoes_in_my_size`, we call `into_iter` to create an iterator that takes ownership of the vector. Then we call `filter` to adapt that iterator into a new iterator that only contains elements for which the closure returns `true`.

The closure captures the `shoe_size` parameter from the environment and compares the value with each shoe’s size, keeping only shoes of the size specified. Finally, calling `collect` gathers the values returned by the adapted iterator into a vector that’s returned by the function.

The test shows that when we call `shoes_in_my_size`, we get back only shoes that have the same size as the value we specified.
