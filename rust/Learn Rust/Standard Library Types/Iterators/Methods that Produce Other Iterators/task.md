Other methods defined on the `Iterator` trait, known as _iterator adaptors_, allow you to change iterators into different kinds of iterators. You can chain multiple calls to iterator adaptors to perform complex actions in a readable way. But because all iterators are lazy, you have to call one of the consuming adaptor methods to get results from calls to iterator adaptors.

The following code snippet shows an example of calling the iterator adaptor method `map`, which takes a closure to call on each item to produce a new iterator. The closure here creates a new iterator in which each item from the vector has been incremented by 1. However, this code produces a warning:

```rust
    let v1: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];

    v1.iter().map(|x| x + 1);
```

##### Calling the iterator adaptor map to create a new iterator

The warning we get is this:

```text
warning: unused `Map` that must be used
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
  |
4 |     v1.iter().map(|x| x + 1);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |
  = note: `#[warn(unused_must_use)]` on by default
  = note: iterators are lazy and do nothing unless consumed
```

The code in the last example doesn’t do anything; the closure we’ve specified never gets called. The warning reminds us why: iterator adaptors are lazy, and we need to consume the iterator here.

To fix this and consume the iterator, we’ll use the `collect` method, which is discussed in **[Chapter 12](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch12-01-accepting-command-line-arguments.html)** of the Rust Book, with `env::args`. This method consumes the iterator and collects the resulting values into a collection data type.

In the following example, we collect the results of iterating over the iterator that’s returned from the call to `map` into a vector. This vector will end up containing each item from the original vector incremented by 1.

```rust
    let v1: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let v2: Vec<_> = v1.iter().map(|x| x + 1).collect();

    assert_eq!(v2, vec![2, 3, 4]);
```

##### Calling the map method to create a new iterator and then calling the collect method to consume the new iterator and create a vector

Because `map` takes a closure, we can specify any operation we want to perform on each item. This is a great example of how closures let you customize some behavior while reusing the iteration behavior that the `Iterator` trait provides.
