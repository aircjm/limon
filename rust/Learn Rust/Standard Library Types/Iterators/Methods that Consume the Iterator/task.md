The `Iterator` trait has a number of different methods with default implementations provided by the standard library; you can find out about these methods by looking in the standard library API documentation for the `Iterator` trait. Some of these methods call the `next` method in their definition, which is why you’re required to implement the `next` method when implementing the `Iterator` trait.

Methods that call `next` are called _consuming adaptors_ because calling them uses up the iterator. One example is the `sum` method, which takes ownership of the iterator and iterates through the items by repeatedly calling `next`, thus consuming the iterator. As it iterates through, it adds each item to a running total and returns the total when the iteration is complete. The code snippet below has a test illustrating the use of the `sum` method:

```rust
    #[test]
    fn iterator_sum() {
        let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

        let v1_iter = v1.iter();

        let total: i32 = v1_iter.sum();

        assert_eq!(total, 6);
    }
```

##### Calling the sum method to get the total of all items in the iterator

We aren’t allowed to use `v1_iter` after the call to `sum` because `sum` takes ownership of the iterator we call it on.
