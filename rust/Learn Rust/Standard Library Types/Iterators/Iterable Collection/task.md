When performing operations on elements within a collection, iterators are essential.
This module helps you get familiar with the structure of using an iterator and
with going through elements within an iterable collection.

Check out the hints if you're stuck!

<div class="hint">We need to apply something to the collection <code>my_fav_fruits</code> before we start to go through

<div class="hint">Step 2 & step 2.1:
Very similar to the lines above and below. You've got this!</div>

<div class="hint">An iterator goes through all elements in a collection, but what if we've run out of
elements? What should we expect here? If you're stuck, take a look at
