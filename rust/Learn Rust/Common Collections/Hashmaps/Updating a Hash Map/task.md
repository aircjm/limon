Although the number of keys and values is growable, each key can only have one
value associated with it at a time. When you want to change the data in a hash
map, you have to decide how to handle the case when a key already has a value
assigned. You could replace the old value with the new value, completely
disregarding the old value. You could keep the old value and ignore the new
value, only adding the new value if the key *doesn’t* already have a value. Or
you could combine the old value and the new value. Let’s look at how to do each
of these!

#### Overwriting a Value

If we insert a key and a value into a hash map and then insert that same key
with a different value, the value associated with that key will be replaced.
Even though the code below calls `insert` twice, the hash map will
only contain one key/value pair because we’re inserting the value for the Blue
team’s key both times.

```rust
    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let mut scores = HashMap::new();

    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 25);

    println!("{:?}", scores);
```

##### Replacing a value stored with a particular key

This code will print `{"Blue": 25}`. The original value of `10` has been
overwritten.

#### Only Inserting a Value If the Key Has No Value

It’s common to check whether a particular key has a value and, if it doesn’t,
insert a value for it. Hash maps have a special API for this called `entry`
that takes the key you want to check as a parameter. The return value of the
`entry` method is an enum called `Entry` that represents a value that might or
might not exist. Let’s say we want to check whether the key for the Yellow team
has a value associated with it. If it doesn’t, we want to insert the value 50,
and the same for the Blue team. Using the `entry` API, the code looks like
this:

```rust
    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let mut scores = HashMap::new();
    scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);

    scores.entry(String::from("Yellow")).or_insert(50);
    scores.entry(String::from("Blue")).or_insert(50);

    println!("{:?}", scores);
```

##### Using the entry method to only insert if the key does not already have a value

The `or_insert` method on `Entry` is defined to return a mutable reference to
the value for the corresponding `Entry` key if that key exists, and if not,
inserts the parameter as the new value for this key and returns a mutable
reference to the new value. This technique is much cleaner than writing the
logic ourselves and, in addition, plays more nicely with the borrow checker.

Running the code above will print `{"Yellow": 50, "Blue": 25}`. The
first call to `entry` will insert the key for the Yellow team with the value
50 because the Yellow team doesn’t have a value already. The second call to
`entry` will not change the hash map because the Blue team already has the
value 25.

#### Updating a Value Based on the Old Value

Another common use case for hash maps is to look up a key’s value and then
update it based on the old value. For instance, the next listing shows code that
counts how many times each word appears in some text. We use a hash map with
the words as keys and increment the value to keep track of how many times we’ve
seen that word. If it’s the first time we’ve seen a word, we’ll first insert
the value 0.

```rust
    use std::collections::HashMap;

    let text = "hello world wonderful world";

    let mut map = HashMap::new();

    for word in text.split_whitespace() {
        let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);
        *count += 1;
    }

    println!("{:?}", map);
```

##### Counting occurrences of words using a hash map that stores words and counts

This code will print `{"world": 2, "hello": 1, "wonderful": 1}`. The
`or_insert` method actually returns a mutable reference (`&mut V`) to the value
for this key. Here we store that mutable reference in the `count` variable, so
in order to assign to that value, we must first dereference `count` using the
asterisk (`*`). The mutable reference goes out of scope at the end of the `for`
loop, so all of these changes are safe and allowed by the borrowing rules.
