When the program has a valid reference, the borrow checker enforces the
ownership and borrowing rules (covered in "Understanding Ownership") to ensure this reference
and any other references to the contents of the vector remain valid. Recall the
rule that states you can’t have mutable and immutable references in the same
scope. That rule applies in the code below, where we hold an immutable reference to
the first element in a vector and try to add an element to the end, which won’t
work if we also try to refer to that element later in the function:

```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
    let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = &v[0];

    v.push(6);

    println!("The first element is: {}", first);
```

#### Attempting to add an element to a vector while holding a reference to an item

Compiling this code will result in this error:

```text
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `v` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --> src/main.rs:6:5
  |
4 |     let first = &v[0];
  |                  - immutable borrow occurs here
5 | 
6 |     v.push(6);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 | 
8 |     println!("The first element is: {}", first);
  |                                          ----- immutable borrow later used here
```

The code above might look like it should work: why should a reference
to the first element care about what changes at the end of the vector? This
error is due to the way vectors work: adding a new element onto the end of the
vector might require allocating new memory and copying the old elements to the
new space, if there isn’t enough room to put all the elements next to each
other where the vector currently is. In that case, the reference to the first
element would be pointing to deallocated memory. The borrowing rules prevent
programs from ending up in that situation.
