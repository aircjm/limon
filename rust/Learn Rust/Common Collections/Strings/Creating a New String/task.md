Many of the same operations available with `Vec<T>` are available with `String` as well, starting with the `new` function to create a string, shown below.
```rust
    let mut s = String::new();
```

##### Example of creating a new, empty String

This line creates a new empty string called `s`, which we can then load data into. Often, we’ll have some initial data that we want to start the string with. For that, we use the `to_string` method, which is available on any type that implements the `Display` trait, as string literals do. The listing below shows two examples.

```rust
    let data = "initial contents";

    let s = data.to_string();

    // the method also works on a literal directly:
    let s = "initial contents".to_string();
```

##### Example of using the to_string method to create a String from a string literal

This code creates a string containing `initial contents`.

We can also use the function `String::from` to create a `String` from a string literal. The code below is equivalent to the code from the previous listing that uses `to_string`.

```rust
    let s = String::from("initial contents");
```

##### Example of using the String::from function to create a String from a string literal

Because strings are used for so many things, we can use many different generic APIs for strings, providing us with a lot of options. Some of them can seem redundant, but they all have their place! In this case, `String::from` and `to_string` do the same thing, so which you choose is a matter of style.

Remember that strings are UTF-8 encoded, so we can include any properly encoded data in them, as shown below.

```rust
    let hello = String::from("السلام عليكم");
    let hello = String::from("Dobrý den");
    let hello = String::from("Hello");
    let hello = String::from("שָׁלוֹם");
    let hello = String::from("नमस्ते");
    let hello = String::from("こんにちは");
    let hello = String::from("안녕하세요");
    let hello = String::from("你好");
    let hello = String::from("Olá");
    let hello = String::from("Здравствуйте");
    let hello = String::from("Hola");
```

##### Example of storing greetings in different languages in strings

All of these are valid `String` values.
