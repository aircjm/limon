Let’s change the `area` function that has a `Rectangle` instance as a parameter
and instead make an `area` method defined on the `Rectangle` struct, as shown
below.

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        rect1.area()
    );
}
```

#### Defining an `area` method on the `Rectangle` struct

To define the function within the context of `Rectangle`, we start an `impl`
(implementation) block. Then we move the `area` function within the `impl`
curly brackets and change the first (and in this case, only) parameter to be
`self` in the signature and everywhere within the body. In `main`, where we
called the `area` function and passed `rect1` as an argument, we can instead
use *method syntax* to call the `area` method on our `Rectangle` instance.
The method syntax goes after an instance: we add a dot followed by the method
name, parentheses, and any arguments.

In the signature for `area`, we use `&self` instead of `rectangle: &Rectangle`
because Rust knows the type of `self` is `Rectangle` due to this method’s being
inside the `impl Rectangle` context. Note that we still need to use the `&`
before `self`, just as we did in `&Rectangle`. Methods can take ownership of
`self`, borrow `self` immutably as we’ve done here, or borrow `self` mutably,
just as they can any other parameter.

We’ve chosen `&self` here for the same reason we used `&Rectangle` in the
function version: we don’t want to take ownership, and we just want to read the
data in the struct, not write to it. If we wanted to change the instance that
we’ve called the method on as part of what the method does, we’d use `&mut
self` as the first parameter. Having a method that takes ownership of the
instance by using just `self` as the first parameter is rare; this technique is
usually used when the method transforms `self` into something else and you want
to prevent the caller from using the original instance after the transformation.

The main benefit of using methods instead of functions, in addition to using
method syntax and not having to repeat the type of `self` in every method’s
signature, is for organization. We’ve put all the things we can do with an
instance of a type in one `impl` block rather than making future users of our
code search for capabilities of `Rectangle` in various places in the library we
provide.

> calling the method on a pointer to the object and need to dereference the
> pointer first. In other words, if `object` is a pointer,
> `object->something()` is similar to `(*object).something()`.

> Rust doesn’t have an equivalent to the `->` operator; instead, Rust has a
> feature called *automatic referencing and dereferencing*. Calling methods is
> one of the few places in Rust that has this behavior.

> Here’s how it works: when you call a method with `object.something()`, Rust
> automatically adds in `&`, `&mut`, or `*` so `object` matches the signature of
> the method. In other words, the following are the same:
>
<!-- CAN'T EXTRACT SEE BUG TODO -->
> ```rust
> p1.distance(&p2);
> (&p1).distance(&p2);
> ```

> The first one looks much cleaner. This automatic referencing behavior works
> because methods have a clear receiver—the type of `self`. Given the receiver
> and name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the method is
> reading (`&self`), mutating (`&mut self`), or consuming (`self`). The fact
> that Rust makes borrowing implicit for method receivers is a big part of
> making ownership ergonomic in practice.
