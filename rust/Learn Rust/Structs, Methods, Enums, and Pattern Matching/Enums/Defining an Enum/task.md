Letâ€™s look at a situation we might want to express in code and see why enums
are useful and more appropriate than structs in this case. Say, we need to work
with IP addresses. Currently, two major standards are used for IP addresses:
version four and version six. These are the only possibilities for an IP
address that our program will come across: we can *enumerate* all possible
variants, which is where enumeration gets its name.

Any IP address can be either a version four or a version six address, but not
both at the same time. That property of IP addresses makes the enum data
structure appropriate because enum values can only be one of its variants.
Both version four and version six addresses are still fundamentally IP
addresses, so they should be treated as the same type when the code is handling
situations that apply to any kind of IP address.

We can express this concept in code by defining an `IpAddrKind` enumeration and
listing the possible kinds an IP address can be, `V4` and `V6`. These are the
variants of the enum:

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}
```

`IpAddrKind` is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in our code.

### Enum Values

We can create instances of each of the two variants of `IpAddrKind` like this:

```rust
let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
```

Note that the variants of the enum are namespaced under its identifier, and we
use a double colon to separate the two. The reason this is useful is that now
both values `IpAddrKind::V4` and `IpAddrKind::V6` are of the same type:
`IpAddrKind`. We can then, for instance, define a function that takes any
`IpAddrKind`:

```rust
fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}
```

And we can call this function with either variant:

```rust
route(IpAddrKind::V4);
route(IpAddrKind::V6);
```
