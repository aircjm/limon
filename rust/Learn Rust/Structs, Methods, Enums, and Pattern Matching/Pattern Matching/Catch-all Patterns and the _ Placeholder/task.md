Using enums, we can also take special actions for a few particular values, but for all other values take one default action. Imagine we’re implementing a game where, if you roll a 3 on a dice roll, your player doesn’t move, but instead gets a new fancy hat. If you roll a 7, your player loses a fancy hat. For all other values, your player moves that number of spaces on the game board. Here’s a `match` that implements that logic, with the result of the dice roll hardcoded rather than a random value, and all other logic represented by functions without bodies because actually implementing them is out of scope for this example:

```rust
let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
    3 => add_fancy_hat(),
    7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
    other => move_player(other),
}

fn add_fancy_hat() {}
fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
fn move_player(num_spaces: u8) {}
```

For the first two arms, the patterns are the literal values 3 and 7. For the last arm that covers every other possible value, the pattern is the variable we’ve chosen to name `other`. The code that runs for the `other` arm uses the variable by passing it to the `move_player` function.

This code compiles, even though we haven’t listed all the possible values a u8 can have, because the last pattern will match all values not specifically listed. This catch-all pattern meets the requirement that `match` must be exhaustive. Note that we have to put the catch-all arm last because the patterns are evaluated in order. Rust will warn us if we add arms after a catch-all because those later arms would never match!

Rust also has a pattern we can use when we don’t want to use the value in the catch-all pattern: `_`, which is a special pattern that matches any value and does not bind to that value. This tells Rust we aren’t going to use the value, so Rust won’t warn us about an unused variable.

Let’s change the rules of the game to be that if you roll anything other than a 3 or a 7, you must roll again. We don’t need to use the value in that case, so we can change our code to use `_` instead of the variable named `other`:

```rust
let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
    3 => add_fancy_hat(),
    7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
    _ => reroll(),
}

fn add_fancy_hat() {}
fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
fn reroll() {}

```

This example also meets the exhaustiveness requirement because we’re explicitly ignoring all other values in the last arm; we haven’t forgotten anything.

If we change the rules of the game one more time, so that nothing else happens on your turn if you roll anything other than a 3 or a 7, we can express that by using the unit value (the empty tuple type we mentioned in “The Tuple Type” section) as the code that goes with the `_` arm:

```rust
let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
    3 => add_fancy_hat(),
    7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
    _ => (),
}

fn add_fancy_hat() {}
fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
```

Here, we’re telling Rust explicitly that we aren’t going to use any other value that doesn’t match a pattern in an earlier arm, and we don’t want to run any code in this case.

There’s more about patterns and matching that we’ll cover in [Chapter 18][ch18-00-patterns] of the Rust Book. For now, we’re going to move on to the if let syntax, which can be useful in situations where the match expression is a bit wordy.
