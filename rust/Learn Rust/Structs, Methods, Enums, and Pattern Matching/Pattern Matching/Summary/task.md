We’ve now covered how to use enums to create custom types that can be one of a
set of enumerated values. We’ve shown how the standard library’s `Option<T>`
type helps you use the type system to prevent errors. When enum values have
data inside them, you can use `match` or `if let` to extract and use those
values, depending on how many cases you need to handle.

Your Rust programs can now express concepts in your domain using structs and
enums. Creating custom types to use in your API ensures type safety: the
compiler will make certain your functions get only values of the type each
function expects.

In order to provide your users with a well-organized API, which is straightforward
to use and only exposes exactly what your users will need, let’s now turn to
Rust’s modules.
