The `if let` syntax lets you combine `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to
handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest. Consider the
program below that matches on an `Option<u8>` value but only wants to
execute code if the value is 3.

```rust
let some_u8_value = Some(0u8);
match some_u8_value {
    Some(3) => println!("three"),
    _ => (),
}
```

We want to do something with the `Some(3)` match but do nothing with any other
`Some<u8>` value or the `None` value. To satisfy the `match` expression, we
have to add `_ => ()` after processing just one variant, which is a lot of
boilerplate code to add.

Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using `if let`. The following
code behaves the same as the `match` in the previous code snippet:

```rust
let some_u8_value = Some(0u8);
if let Some(3) = some_u8_value {
    println!("three");
}
```

The syntax `if let` takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal
sign. It works the same way as a `match`, where the expression is given to the
`match` and the pattern is its first arm.

Using `if let` means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code.
However, you lose the exhaustive checking that `match` enforces. Choosing
between `match` and `if let` depends on what youâ€™re doing in your particular
situation and whether gaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for
losing exhaustive checking.

In other words, you can think of `if let` as syntax sugar for a `match` that
runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other values.

We can include an `else` with an `if let`. The block of code that goes with the
`else` is the same as the block of code that would go with the `_` case in the
`match` expression that is equivalent to the `if let` and `else`. Recall the
`Coin` enum definition in the listing from the previous section, where the `Quarter` variant also held a
`UsState` value. If we wanted to count all non-quarter coins we see while also
announcing the state of the quarters, we could do that with a `match`
expression like this:

```rust
let mut count = 0;
match coin {
    Coin::Quarter(state) => println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state),
    _ => count += 1,
}
```

Or we could use an `if let` and `else` expression like this:

```rust
let mut count = 0;
if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
    println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
} else {
    count += 1;
}
```

If you have a situation in which your program has logic that is too verbose to
express using a `match`, remember that `if let` is in your Rust toolbox as well.
