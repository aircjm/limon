So far, we’ve written tests that panic when they fail. We can also write tests that use `Result<T, E>`! Here’s the test from [one of the previous tasks](course://Writing Automated Tests/How to Write Tests/The Anatomy of a Test Function), rewritten to use `Result<T, E>` and return an `Err` instead of panicking:

```rust
    #[cfg(test)]
    mod tests {
        #[test]
        fn it_works() -> Result<(), String> {
            if 2 + 2 == 4 {
                Ok(())
            } else {
                Err(String::from("two plus two does not equal four"))
            }
        }
    }
```

The `it_works` function now has a return type, `Result<(), String>`. In the body of the function, rather than calling the `assert_eq!` macro, we return `Ok(())` when the test passes and an `Err` with a `String` inside when the test fails.

Writing tests so they return a `Result<T, E>` enables you to use the question mark operator in the body of tests, which can be a convenient way to write tests that should fail if any operation within them returns an `Err` variant.

You can’t use the `#[should_panic]` annotation on tests that use `Result<T, E>`. Instead, you should return an `Err` value directly when the test should fail.

Now that you know several ways to write tests, let’s look at what is happening when we run our tests and explore the different options we can use with `cargo test`.
