You can also add a custom message to be printed with the failure message as optional arguments to the `assert!`, `assert_eq!`, and `assert_ne!` macros. Any arguments specified after the one required argument to `assert!` or the two required arguments to `assert_eq!` and `assert_ne!` are passed along to the `format!` macro (discussed in Chapter 8 in the [“Concatenation with the `+` Operator or the `format!` Macro”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch08-02-strings.html#concatenation-with-the--operator-or-the-format-macro) section of the Book), so you can pass a format string that contains `{}` placeholders and values to go in those placeholders. Custom messages are useful to document what an assertion means; when a test fails, you’ll have a better idea of what the problem is with the code.

For example, let’s say we have a function that greets people by name and we want to test that the name we pass into the function appears in the output:

```rust
    pub fn greeting(name: &str) -> String {
        format!("Hello {}!", name)
    }

    #[cfg(test)]
    mod tests {
        use super::*;

        #[test]
        fn greeting_contains_name() {
            let result = greeting("Carol");
            assert!(result.contains("Carol"));
        }
    }
```

The requirements for this program haven’t been agreed upon yet, and we’re pretty sure the `Hello` text at the beginning of the greeting will change. We decided we don’t want to have to update the test when the requirements change, so instead of checking for exact equality to the value returned from the `greeting` function, we’ll just assert that the output contains the text of the input parameter.

Let’s introduce a bug into this code by changing `greeting` to not include `name` to see what this test failure looks like:

```rust
    pub fn greeting(name: &str) -> String {
        String::from("Hello!")
    }
```

Running this test produces the following:

```text
running 1 test
test tests::greeting_contains_name ... FAILED

failures:

---- tests::greeting_contains_name stdout ----
thread 'main' panicked at 'assertion failed: result.contains("Carol")', src/lib.rs:12:9
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace


failures:
    tests::greeting_contains_name
```

This result just indicates that the assertion failed and which line the assertion is on. A more useful failure message in this case would print the value we got from the `greeting` function. Let’s change the test function, giving it a custom failure message made from a format string with a placeholder filled in with the actual value we got from the `greeting` function:

```rust
#[test]
fn greeting_contains_name() {
    let result = greeting("Carol");
    assert!(
        result.contains("Carol"),
        "Greeting did not contain name, value was `{}`",
        result
    );
}
```

Now when we run the test, we’ll get a more informative error message:

```text
---- tests::greeting_contains_name stdout ----
thread 'main' panicked at 'Greeting did not contain name, value was `Hello!`', src/lib.rs:12:9
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

We can see the value we actually got in the test output, which would help us debug what happened instead of what we were expecting to happen.
