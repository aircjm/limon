We have the `times_two` function in `src/lib.rs` and 
integration tests in `tests/tests.rs`.  
The tests aren't testing our function â€” make them do that in such a way that the tests pass. Then write a second test that tests that we get the result we expect to get when we call `times_two` with a negative number.

No hints, you can do this :)
