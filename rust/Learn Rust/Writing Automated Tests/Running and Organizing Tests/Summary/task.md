Rust’s testing features provide a way to specify how code should function to
ensure it continues to work as you expect, even as you make changes. Unit tests
exercise different parts of a library separately and can test private
implementation details. Integration tests check that many parts of the library
work together correctly, and they use the library’s public API to test the code
in the same way external code will use it. Even though Rust’s type system and
ownership rules help prevent some kinds of bugs, tests are still important to
reduce logic bugs having to do with how your code is expected to behave.
