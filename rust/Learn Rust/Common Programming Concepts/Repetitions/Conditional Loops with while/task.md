It’s often useful for a program to evaluate a condition within a loop. While the condition is true, the loop runs. When the condition ceases to be true, the program calls `break`, stopping the loop. This loop type could be implemented using a combination of `loop`, `if`, `else`, and `break`; you could try that now in a program if you’d like.

However, this pattern is so common that Rust has a built-in language construct for it, called a `while` loop. Listing 3-3 uses while: the program loops three times, counting down each time, and then, after the loop, it prints another message and exits.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{}!", number);

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```
##### Example of using a while loop to run code while a condition holds true

This construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if you used `loop`, `if`, `else`, and `break`, and it’s clearer. While a condition holds true, the code runs; otherwise, it exits the loop.
