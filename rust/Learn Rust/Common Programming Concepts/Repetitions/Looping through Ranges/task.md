The safety and conciseness of `for` loops make them the most commonly used loop construct in Rust. Even in situations in which you want to run some code a certain number of times, as in the countdown example that used a `while` loop in "Example of using a while loop to run code while a condition holds true", most Rustaceans would use a `for` loop. The way to do that would be to use a `Range`, which is a type provided by the standard library that generates all numbers in sequence starting from one number and ending before another number.

Here’s what the countdown would look like using a `for` loop and another method we’ve not yet talked about, `rev`, to reverse the range:

```rust
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{}!", number);
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

This code is a bit nicer, isn’t it?
