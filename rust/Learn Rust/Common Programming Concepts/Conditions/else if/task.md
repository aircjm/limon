You can have multiple conditions by combining `if` and `else` in an `else if` expression. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

This program has four possible paths it can take. After running it, you should see the following output:

```text
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
number is divisible by 3
```

When this program executes, it checks each `if` expression in turn and executes the first body for which the condition holds true. Note that even though 6 is divisible by 2, we don’t see the output 'number is divisible by 2', nor do we see the 'number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2' text from the `else` block. That’s because Rust only executes the block for the first true condition, and once it finds one, it doesn’t even check the rest.

Using too many `else if` expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more than one, you might want to refactor your code. [Chapter 6](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch06-00-enums.html) describes a powerful Rust branching construct called `match` for these cases.
