Like immutable variables, _constants_ are values that are bound to a name and are not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants and variables.

First, you aren’t allowed to use `mut` with constants. Constants aren’t just immutable by default—they’re always immutable. You declare constants using the `const` keyword instead of the `let` keyword, and the type of the value _must_ be annotated. We’re about to cover types and type annotations in the next lesson, [Basic Data Types](course://Common Programming Concepts/Basic Data Types), so don’t worry about the details right now. Just know that you must always annotate the type.

Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.

The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.

Here’s an example of a constant declaration:

```rust

const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
```

The constant’s name is `THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS` and its value is set to the result of multiplying 60 (the number of seconds in a minute) by 60 (the number of minutes in an hour) by 3 (the number of hours we want to count in this program). Rust’s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words. The compiler is able to evaluate a limited set of operations at compile time, which lets us choose to write out this value in a way that’s easier to understand and verify, rather than setting this constant to the value 10,800. See the [Rust Reference’s section on constant evaluation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/const_eval.html) for more information on what operations can be used when declaring constants.

Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope they were declared in. This property makes constants useful for values in your application domain that multiple parts of the program might need to know about, such as the maximum number of points any player of a game is allowed to earn or the speed of light.

Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in conveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code. It also helps to have only one place in your code you would need to change if the hardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.
