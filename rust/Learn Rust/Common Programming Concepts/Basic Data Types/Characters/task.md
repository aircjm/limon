So far we’ve worked only with numbers, but Rust supports letters too. Rust’s `char` type is the language’s most primitive alphabetic type, and the following code shows one way to use it. (Note that `char` literals are specified with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.)

```rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z = 'ℤ';
    let heart = '❤';
}
```

Rust’s `char` type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid `char` values in Rust. Unicode Scalar Values range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive. However, a “character” isn’t really a concept in Unicode, so your human intuition for what a “character” is may not match up with what a `char` is in Rust. We’ll discuss this topic in detail in [“Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch08-02-strings.html#storing-utf-8-encoded-text-with-strings) in Chapter 8.
