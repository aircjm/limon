As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: `true` and `false`. Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using `bool`. For example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

The main way to use Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an `if` expression. Weâ€™ll cover how `if` expressions work in Rust in the ["Conditions"](course://Common Programming Concepts/Conditions/Intro) lesson of this section.
