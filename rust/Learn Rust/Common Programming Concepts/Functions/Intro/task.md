Functions are pervasive in Rust code. You’ve already seen one of the most important functions in the language: the `main` function, which is the entry point of many programs. You’ve also seen the `fn` keyword, which allows you to declare new functions.

Rust code uses _snake case_ as the conventional style for function and variable names. In snake case, all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words. Here’s a program that contains an example function definition:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```

Function definitions in Rust start with `fn` and have a set of parentheses after the function name. The curly brackets tell the compiler where the function body begins and ends.

We can call any function we’ve defined by entering its name followed by a set of parentheses. Because `another_function` is defined in the program, it can be called from inside the `main` function. Note that we defined `another_function` _after_ the `main` function in the source code; we could have defined it before as well. Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re defined somewhere.

Let’s run the code from the example above to explore functions further. Place the `another_function` example in src/main.rs and run it. You should see the following output:

```text
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.28 secs
     Running `target/debug/functions`
Hello, world!
Another function.
```

The lines execute in the order in which they appear in the `main` function. First, the “Hello, world!” message prints, and then `another_function` is called and its message is printed.
