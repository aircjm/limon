This store is having a sale: if the price is an even number, you get 10 (money unit) off, but if it's an odd number, it's 3 (money unit) less.

<div class="hint">
  The error message points to line 6 and says it expects a type after the <code>-></code>.
  This is where the function's return type should be â€“ take a look at the <code>is_even</code> function for an example!
</div>
