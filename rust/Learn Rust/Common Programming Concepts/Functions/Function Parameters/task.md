Functions can also be defined to have _parameters_, which are special variables that are part of a function’s signature. When a function has parameters, you can provide it with concrete values for those parameters. Technically, the concrete values are called _arguments_, but in casual conversation, people tend to use the words _parameter_ and _argument_ interchangeably for either the variables in a function’s definition or the concrete values passed in when you call a function.

The following rewritten version of `another_function` shows what parameters look like in Rust:

```rust
   fn main() {
       another_function(5);
   }
   
   fn another_function(x: i32) {
       println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
   }
```   

Try running this program; you should get the following output:

```text
   $ cargo run
      Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
       Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.21 secs
        Running `target/debug/functions`
   The value of x is: 5
```

The declaration of `another_function` has one parameter named `x`. The type of `x` is specified as `i32`. When `5` is passed to `another_function`, the `println!` macro puts `5` where the pair of curly brackets were in the format string.

In function signatures, you _must_ declare the type of each parameter. This is a deliberate decision in Rust’s design: requiring type annotations in function definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to figure out what you mean.

When you want a function to have multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with commas, like this:

```rust
   fn main() {
       another_function(5, 6);
   }
   
   fn another_function(x: i32, y: i32) {
       println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
       println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
   }
```   
This example creates a function with two parameters, both of which are `i32` types. The function then prints the values in both of its parameters. Note that function parameters don’t all need to be the same type, they just happen to be in this example.

Let’s try running this code. Replace the program currently in your functions project’s src/main.rs file with the preceding example and run it:

```text
   $ cargo run
      Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
       Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31 secs
        Running `target/debug/functions`
   The value of x is: 5
   The value of y is: 6
```

Because we called the function with `5` as the value for `x` and `6` is passed as the value for `y`, the two strings are printed with these values.
