Create an array with at least 100 elements. Run the main.rs file to see what 
your code outputs. Do not change the lines that are returned &mdash; the 
test checks for the string `"Wow, that's a big array!"`.

<div class="hint">
  There's a shorthand to initialize Arrays with a certain size that does not require you to type in 100 items (but you certainly can if you want!).

  For example, you can do:
  ```rust
  let array = ["Are we there yet?"; 10];
  ```
</div>

Bonus: what are some other things you could have that would return true for `a.len() >= 100`?
