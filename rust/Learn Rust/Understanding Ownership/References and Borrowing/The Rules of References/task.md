*   References must always be valid.

Next, we’ll look at a different kind of reference: slices.

_You can refer to the following chapter in the Rust Programming Language Book: [References and Borrowing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#references-and-borrowing)_
