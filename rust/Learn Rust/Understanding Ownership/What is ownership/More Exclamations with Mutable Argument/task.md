Make me compile without adding new lines â€” just changing the existing lines! (No lines with multiple semicolons necessary!)

<div class="hint">

 The difference between this one and the previous ones is that the first line of `fn add_exclamation`, which had `let mut s;`, is no longer there.
  Instead of adding that line back, you can add `mut`, which will change the existing binding to mutable. :)
