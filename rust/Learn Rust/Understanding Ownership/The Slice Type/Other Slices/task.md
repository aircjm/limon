String slices, as you might imagine, are specific to strings. But there’s a more general slice type, too. Consider this array:

```rust
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Just as we might want to refer to a part of a string, we might want to refer to part of an array. We’d do so like this:

```rust
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let slice = &a[1..3];
```

This slice has the type `&[i32]`. It works the same way as string slices do, by storing a reference to the first element and a length. You’ll use this kind of slice for all sorts of other collections. We’ll discuss these collections in detail [later](course://Common Collections/Vectors/Intro).
