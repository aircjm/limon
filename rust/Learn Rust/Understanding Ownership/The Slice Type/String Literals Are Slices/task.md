Recall that we talked about string literals being stored inside the binary. Now that we know about slices, we can properly understand string literals:

```rust
    let s = "Hello, world!";
```

The type of `s` here is `&str`: itâ€™s a slice pointing to that specific point of the binary. This is also why string literals are immutable; `&str` is an immutable reference.
