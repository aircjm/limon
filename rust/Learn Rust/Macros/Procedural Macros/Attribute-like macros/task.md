Attribute-like macros are similar to custom derive macros, but instead of generating code for the `derive` attribute, they allow you to create new attributes. They’re also more flexible: `derive` only works for structs and enums; attributes can be applied to other items as well, such as functions. Here’s an example of using an attribute-like macro: say you have an attribute named `route` that annotates functions when using a web application framework:

```rust
    #[route(GET, "/")]
    fn index() {
```

This `#[route]` attribute would be defined by the framework as a procedural macro. The signature of the macro definition function would look like this:

```rust
    #[proc_macro_attribute]
    pub fn route(attr: TokenStream, item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
```

Here, we have two parameters of type `TokenStream`. The first is for the contents of the attribute: the `GET, "/"` part. The second is the body of the item the attribute is attached to: in this case, `fn index() {}` and the rest of the function’s body.

Other than that, attribute-like macros work the same way as custom derive macros: you create a crate with the `proc-macro` crate type and implement a function that generates the code you want!
