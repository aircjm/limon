Function-like macros define macros that look like function calls. Similarly to `macro_rules!` macros, they’re more flexible than functions; for example, they can take an unknown number of arguments. However, `macro_rules!` macros can be defined only using the match-like syntax we discussed in the section [“Declarative Macros with `macro_rules!` for General Metaprogramming”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch19-06-macros.html#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming) earlier. Function-like macros take a `TokenStream` parameter and their definition manipulates that `TokenStream` using Rust code as the other two types of procedural macros do. An example of a function-like macro is an `sql!` macro that might be called like so:

```rust
    let sql = sql!(SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id=1);
```

This macro would parse the SQL statement inside it and check that it’s syntactically correct, which is much more complex processing than a `macro_rules!` macro can do. The `sql!` macro would be defined like this:

```rust
    #[proc_macro]
    pub fn sql(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
```

This definition is similar to the custom derive macro’s signature: we receive the tokens that are inside the parentheses and return the code we wanted to generate.
