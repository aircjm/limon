Let’s create a crate named `hello_macro` that defines a trait named `HelloMacro` with one associated function named `hello_macro`. Rather than making our crate users implement the `HelloMacro` trait for each of their types, we’ll provide a procedural macro so users can annotate their type with `#[derive(HelloMacro)]` to get a default implementation of the `hello_macro` function. The default implementation will print `Hello, Macro! My name is TypeName!` where `TypeName` is the name of the type on which this trait has been defined. In other words, we’ll write a crate that enables another programmer to write code like the one below using our crate.

```rust
    use hello_macro::HelloMacro;
    use hello_macro_derive::HelloMacro;

    #[derive(HelloMacro)]
    struct Pancakes;

    fn main() {
        Pancakes::hello_macro();
    }
```

##### The code a user of our crate will be able to write when using our procedural macro

This code will print `Hello, Macro! My name is Pancakes!` when we’re done.
