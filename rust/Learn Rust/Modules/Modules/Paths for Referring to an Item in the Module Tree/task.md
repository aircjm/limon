To show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a _path_ in the same way we use a path when navigating a filesystem. If we want to call a function, we need to know its path.

A _path_ can take two forms:

*   An _absolute path_ starts from a crate root by using a crate name or a literal `crate`.
*   A _relative path_ starts from the current module and uses `self`, `super`, or an identifier in the current module.

Both absolute and relative paths are followed by one or more identifiers separated by double colons (`::`).

Let’s return to the example in the first code snippet in the previous task. How do we call the `add_to_waitlist` function? This is the same as asking, what’s the path of the `add_to_waitlist` function? In the code snippet below, we simplified our code a bit by removing some of the modules and functions. We’ll show two ways to call the `add_to_waitlist` function from a new function `eat_at_restaurant` defined in the crate root. The `eat_at_restaurant` function is part of our library crate’s public API, so we mark it with the `pub` keyword. In the "Exposing Paths with the `pub` Keyword" section, we’ll go into more detail about `pub`. Note that this example won’t compile just yet; we’ll explain why in a bit.

```rust
    mod front_of_house {
        mod hosting {
            fn add_to_waitlist() {}
        }
    }

    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        // Absolute path
        crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

        // Relative path
        front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }
```

##### Calling the add_to_waitlist function using absolute and relative paths

The first time we call the `add_to_waitlist` function in `eat_at_restaurant`, we use an absolute path. The `add_to_waitlist` function is defined in the same crate as `eat_at_restaurant`, which means we can use the `crate` keyword to start an absolute path.

After `crate`, we include each of the successive modules until we make our way to `add_to_waitlist`. You can imagine a filesystem with the same structure, and we’d specify the path `/front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist` to run the `add_to_waitlist` program; using the `crate` name to start from the crate root is like using `/` to start from the filesystem root in your shell.

The second time we call `add_to_waitlist` in `eat_at_restaurant`, we use a relative path. The path starts with `front_of_house`, the name of the module defined at the same level of the module tree as `eat_at_restaurant`. Here the filesystem equivalent would be using the path `front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist`. Starting with a name means that the path is relative.

Choosing whether to use a relative or absolute path is a decision you’ll make based on your project. The decision should depend on whether you’re more likely to move item definition code separately from or together with the code that uses the item. For example, if we move the `front_of_house` module and the `eat_at_restaurant` function into a module named `customer_experience`, we’d need to update the absolute path to `add_to_waitlist`, but the relative path would still be valid. However, if we moved the `eat_at_restaurant` function separately into a module named `dining`, the absolute path to the `add_to_waitlist` call would stay the same, but the relative path would need to be updated. Our preference is to specify absolute paths because it’s more likely to move code definitions and item calls independently of each other.

Let’s try to compile the code snippet above and find out why it won’t compile yet! The error we get is shown in the code snippet below.

##### Compiler errors from building the code from the example above

The error messages say that module `hosting` is private. In other words, we have the correct paths for the `hosting` module and the `add_to_waitlist` function, but Rust won’t let us use them because it doesn’t have access to the private sections.

Modules aren’t useful only for organizing your code. They also define Rust’s _privacy boundary_: the line that encapsulates the implementation details external code isn’t allowed to know about, call, or rely on. So, if you want to make an item like a function or struct private, you put it in a module.

The way privacy works in Rust is that all items (functions, methods, structs, enums, modules, and constants) are private by default. Items in a parent module can’t use the private items inside child modules, but items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules. The reason is that child modules wrap and hide their implementation details, but the child modules can see the context in which they’re defined. To continue with the restaurant metaphor, think of the privacy rules as being like the back office of a restaurant: what goes on in there is private to restaurant customers, but office managers can see and do everything in the restaurant in which they operate.

Rust chose to have the module system function this way so that hiding inner implementation details is the default. That way, you know which parts of the inner code you can change without breaking outer code. But you can expose inner parts of child modules' code to outer ancestor modules by using the `pub` keyword to make an item public.
