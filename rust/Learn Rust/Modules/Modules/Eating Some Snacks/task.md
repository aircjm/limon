You can bring module paths into scopes and provide new names for them with the
`use` and `as` keywords. Fix these `use` statements to make the code compile.


<div class="hint">
The <code>delicious_snacks</code> module is trying to present an external interface that is 
different than its internal structure (the <code>fruits</code> and <code>veggies</code> modules and
associated constants). Complete the <code>use</code> statements to fit the uses in main and
find the one keyword missing for both constants.
