In the next example, we’ll get the value from the receiving end of the channel in the main thread. This is like retrieving the rubber duck from the water at the end of the river or like getting a chat message.

```rust
    use std::thread;
    use std::sync::mpsc;

    fn main() {
        let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

        thread::spawn(move || {
            let val = String::from("hi");
            tx.send(val).unwrap();
        });

        let received = rx.recv().unwrap();
        println!("Got: {}", received);
    }
```

##### Receiving the value “hi” in the main thread and printing it

The receiving end of a channel has two useful methods: `recv` and `try_recv`. We’re using `recv`, short for _receive_, which will block the main thread’s execution and wait until a value is sent down the channel. Once a value is sent, `recv` will return it in a `Result<T, E>`. When the sending end of the channel closes, `recv` will return an error to signal that no more values will be coming.

The `try_recv` method doesn’t block, but will instead return a `Result<T, E>` immediately: an `Ok` value holding a message if one is available and an `Err` value if there aren’t any messages this time. Using `try_recv` is useful if this thread has other work to do while waiting for messages: we could write a loop that calls `try_recv` every so often, handles a message if one is available, and otherwise does other work for a little while until checking again.

We’ve used `recv` in this example for simplicity; we don’t have any other work for the main thread to do other than wait for messages, so blocking the main thread is appropriate.

When we run the code in the snippet below, we’ll see the value printed from the main thread:

```text
    Got: hi
```

Perfect!
