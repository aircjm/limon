Let’s move the transmitting end into a spawned thread and have it send one string so the spawned thread is communicating with the main thread, as shown in the code snippet below. This is like putting a rubber duck in the river upstream or sending a chat message from one thread to another.

```rust
    use std::thread;
    use std::sync::mpsc;

    fn main() {
        let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

        thread::spawn(move || {
            let val = String::from("hi");
            tx.send(val).unwrap();
        });
    }
```

##### Moving tx to a spawned thread and sending “hi”

Again, we’re using `thread::spawn` to create a new thread and then using `move` to move `tx` into the closure so the spawned thread owns `tx`. The spawned thread needs to own the transmitting end of the channel to be able to send messages through the channel.

The transmitting end has a `send` method that takes the value we want to send. The `send` method returns a `Result<T, E>` type, so if the receiving end has already been dropped and there’s nowhere to send a value, the send operation will return an error. In this example, we’re calling `unwrap` to panic in case of an error. But in a real application, we would handle it properly: return to Chapter 9 to review strategies for proper error handling.
