You can get started by [installing Go](https://go.dev/doc/install/).


The [Go Documentation](https://go.dev/doc/) is a great place to start.
It contains references, tutorials, videos, and more.

To learn how to organize and work with Go code, read [How to Write Go Code](https://go.dev/doc/code).

If you need help with the standard library, see the [package reference](https://go.dev/pkg/). For help with the language itself, you might be surprised to find the [Language Spec](https://go.dev/ref/spec) is quite readable.

To further explore Go's concurrency model, watch
[Go Concurrency Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kdp27TYZs)
([slides](https://go.dev/talks/2012/concurrency.slide))
and
[Advanced Go Concurrency Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDDwwePbDtw)
([slides](https://go.dev/talks/2013/advconc.slide))
and read the
[Share Memory by Communicating](https://go.dev/doc/codewalk/sharemem/)
codewalk.

To get started writing web applications, watch
[A simple programming environment](https://vimeo.com/53221558)
([slides](https://go.dev/talks/2012/simple.slide))
and read the
[Writing Web Applications](https://go.dev/doc/articles/wiki/) tutorial.

The [First Class Functions in Go](https://go.dev/doc/codewalk/functions/) codewalk gives an interesting perspective on Go's function types.

The [Go Blog](https://go.dev/blog/) has a large archive of informative Go articles.

Visit [the Go home page](https://go.dev/) for more.
