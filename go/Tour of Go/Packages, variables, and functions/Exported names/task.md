In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter.
For example, `Pizza` is an exported name, as is `Pi`, which is exported from
the `math` package.

`pizza` and `pi` do not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.

When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names.
Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

Run the code. Notice the error message.

To fix the error, rename `math.pi` to `math.Pi` and try it again.
