The type `[n]T` is an array of `n` values of type `T`.

The expression

	var a [10]int

declares a variable `a` as an array of ten integers.

An array's length is part of its type, so arrays cannot be resized.
This seems limiting, but don't worry;
Go provides a convenient way of working with arrays.
