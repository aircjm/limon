A slice has both a _length_ and a _capacity_.

The length of a slice is the number of elements it contains.

The capacity of a slice is the number of elements in the underlying array,
counting from the first element in the slice.

The length and capacity of a slice `s` can be obtained using the expressions
`len(s)` and `cap(s)`.

You can extend a slice's length by re-slicing it,
provided it has sufficient capacity.
Try changing one of the slice operations in the example program to extend it
beyond its capacity and see what happens.
